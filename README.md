IVF is not just medical â€“ itâ€™s an emotional journey. The injections, wait for results, failed attempts â€“ all this can create big stress.

To handle it, first accept that it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Talk to your partner, family, or friends. Donâ€™t keep everything inside.

Try simple things like yoga, music, watching light movies, or walking in nature. Avoid people who pressurise you or give negative energy.

You can also join fertility support groups where people share similar stories. It helps to know youâ€™re not alone.

Most importantly, choose a fertility clinic that supports you emotionally, not just medically.

At Ayuh Fertility Centre, they provide full care â€“ emotional, physical, and mental. Patients say the peaceful environment and kind team helps a lot during tough days.
